The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment.

2,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","Criminal Law – Appeal – AcquittalCriminal Procedure – AppealThe Crown appealed the decision of a summary conviction appeal court judge pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code.
The judge had held that s. 34(1) of the Code would eliminate any defences against self-defence.
HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction of the respondent entered the Provincial Court was reinstated.
1)
 The court found that the trial judge had erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal (appeal decision).
The video of the incident shows that the respondent approached the respondent after he challenged him to fight.
His hands were at his side, he was much smaller and much more frail than the respondent and he was very intoxicated.","Criminal Law – Assault Causing Bodily Harm – Conviction – AppealThe appellant was charged and convicted in Provincial Court with committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code.
He appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen’s Bench sitting as summary conviction appeal court.

The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court pursuant to ss.
839 of the Code.HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction of the appellant was reinstated.
1)
The trial judge had made a number of errors.
First, he transformed the subjective and objective aspects of the proportional inquiry into purely objective test; second, once he accepted that the appellant subjectively believed that his use of force was reasonable, the trial judge should have inquired whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of any reasonable grounds for that subjective belief or, put another way, whether there was any doubt that reasonable person in the situation might have used the force actually employed; third, his approach caused him to assess the correctness of","Criminal Law – Assault – Assault Causing Bodily Harm – AppealThe Crown appealed the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code.HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction of the respondent was entered in Provincial Court.
The trial judge erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal.
There was a significant piece of evidence and the appeal court judge found it was open to him to review the video in detail and draw his own conclusions from it.
However, the trial judge also erred by failing to analyze the timing of the events depicted.
In this case, the respondent had been arrested many times for being intoxicated in public place and had taken him to the Brief Detox Unit (BDU) to sleep it off.
Although the respondent resisted arrest passively and physically on occasion, he could at times resist arrest.
When the respondent got to the BDU, he sat on a cement wall and told the respondent that he would have to go to jail.
He informed the respondent twice that he was under arrest because he believed that he had HIV and Hepatitis A.
The trial judge found that the respondent did not strike actual physical contact and had","Criminal Law – Assault Causing Bodily Harm – Conviction – AppealThe respondent was charged and convicted in Provincial Court with committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code.
He appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen’s Bench.
The summary conviction appeal court judge determined that the Provincial Court judge had erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal (appeal decision).
The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court.HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction entered was reinstated.
1)
The court found that the trial judge erred by: 1) taking the measure of the respondent’ use of force, and in disregarding the evidence of the witness.
There were certain factors that could not go unnoticed.
They included the history between the parties, including the appellant's knowledge that the witness suffered from Hepatitis and was HIV positive; b) the limited time the appellant had to react once he apprehended the witness; c) the potential harm the appellant faced if he was struck or spit upon; d) the training the appellant received; and e) the fact that the force used was in keeping with the training provided to police officers.
These factors raised significant doubt of the appellant.
In particular, the court could not find that the Crown had discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the option used by the appellant was not one that a reasonable person in his position might be expected to employ.
It necessarily follows that verdict of not guilty must be entered.","Criminal Law – Assault – Assault Causing Bodily Harm – AppealThe Crown appealed the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code.HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction entered in the Provincial Court was reinstated.
The court found that the trial judge had erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal (appeal decision).
The appeal court judge erred by: 1) disregarding the evidence of the defence witness; 2) inappropriately taking into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the level of force was objectively reasonable; and 3) measuring the force used by the respondent to nicety.
In the course of coming to the conclusion that the respondent was reasonably justified in kicking the appellant in the abdomen, driving him backwards, and causing him to fall and hurt himself, the judge instructed himself to disregard the witness’s opinion that the use of force had been proportionate indicating that there was difference between whether it was consistent with police training and whether it used was lawful.
Two preliminary matters warrant mention.
Before the court, both the Crown and the defence accepted that the provisions of s. 34(1) of the Code as it read prior to May 2012 were applicable.
This accords with two recent cases.
Both Evans, 2015 BCCA 46 and Bengy, 2015 ONCA 397 (CanLII), 325 CCC (3d) 22, conclude that the amendments to the Code made effective after March 2013 are prospective in effect.
Accordingly, the trial court judge declined to decide which provisions of the Act applied.
He determined that the best approach would be to decide the case on the basis of whichever wording was more beneficial to the respondent.
As such, the appeal court found it was open to him to review the video in detail and draw his own conclusions from it.
With respect to the appeal, the court held that the judge had made a number of errors.
First, he transformed the subjective and objective aspects of the proportional inquiry into purely objective test.
Second, once he accepted the respondent subjectively believed that his use was reasonable, he should have inquired whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of any reasonable grounds for that subjective belief or put another way, whether there was any doubt that reasonable person in the situation of the respondent might have used the force actually employed.
Third, once the respondent believed that the force was justified, the respondent should have"
3,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant corporation is charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.

4,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment which awarded damages to the plaintiffs for damage to a broken concrete beam and other repairs.
The plaintiff purchased the house from the appellants pursuant to the Residential Contract of Purchase and Sale (the contract) dated July 4, 2007.

When he sought professional's opinion, he was advised that the appearance of the broken edges appeared to be indicative of significant passage of time and that the main triple-ply wooden beam (wooden beam) which had sat upon the concrete Grade beam was also rotten and would have to be replaced.

5,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding.

He appealed that conviction and the new trial was held.
HELD:
 The appeal was allowed and the acquittal was set aside, a new trial ordered and the trial was heard in the absence of the appellant.
The appellant did not establish an abuse of process or misconduct by the Crown because there were three trials.
However, the trial judge concluded that the appellant rebutted the presumption by the amendments of s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that he was in actual care or control as result of occupying the driver’s seat at the time of the traffic stop.
Therefore, the appellant was obliged by the amended section to prove three elements to overcome the presumption: 1) that the ASD was malfunctioning or operated improperly, that the malfunction or improper operation resulted in the determination the appellant's blood exceeded the approved level, and that the concentration of alcohol would not in fact have exceeded that level.

The trial judge found that the appellant had rebutted the presumption contained in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that he was in actual care or control of the vehicle.
As such, the appellant was obliged by the amended section to prove three elements to overcome the presumption: that the ASD was malfunctioning or operated improperly, that the malfunction or improper operation resulted in the determination that the accused‒s blood exceeded the approved level, and that the concentration of alcohol in the blood would not in fact have exceeded that level.
These three elements would have to be established by the appellant to establish his evidence of consumption by means of an approved screening device (ASD).

Ultimately the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench, the acquittal was set aside, and a new trial was ordered.HELD: The appeal was allowed and the trial judge stayed the proceedings.
There was no evidence to support the finding that the officer did not have reasonable grounds to believe the accused had consumed alcohol within 15 minutes of taking the roadside test.

There was viva voce evidence at the third trial from the appellant and from the two investigating officers.

He adopted Green P.C.J.
's reasoning, which included finding the appellant was planning on resting and sleeping for number of hours before driving to Manitoba, and did not occupy the driver's seat for the purpose of setting his vehicle in motion.
In doing so, he found that he was entitled to consider the evidence as whole, including the results of the ASD and Intoxilyzer.
However, that concession did not fully dispose of the fourth ground of appeal because the appellant asserted for reasons that were more fully explained below that this error compromised his right to full and fair trial in fashion that could only be cured by fourth trial and that stay of proceedings should accordingly issue.CORRIGENDUM dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext.
Fulltext of judgment follows:[1]
The Crown conceded that the learned trial judge erred in finding that the 2008 amendments to the Code, which established three prerequisites to be met by an accused attempting to establish evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, were retrospective.
Although the learned judge was correct as to the state of the law in Saskatchewan at the time he reached that conclusion, the Supreme Court of Canada reached the opposite conclusion in its later decision in Dineley, [2012]
SCR 272.

However that concession, however, did not completely dispose of that fourth ground.
On the appeal, the appellant correctly notes that the test to be applied in determining whether the accused has de facto care andcontrol of vehicle is that established by Boudreault, ["
6,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Students' Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the 'Federation').

1)
The University's response to the report of the Elections Board and the inconvenient truths noted therein was to ignore the very process it created to ensure there was a fair referendum.
However, that does not affect the bottom line of the Court's view of this case nor, expect, was the notion of the Council's decision being preordained essential to the conclusion of the chambers judge.

In light of this history, agree with the respondent that the student's decision to reject the Election Board's decision entitled him to relief under the Act, having expressly amended the Elections and Referenda Policy for the specific purpose of giving the Board 'final authority' with respect to the referendum, it was unfair for the Council to then reverse field for purposes of endorsing the referendum result.
That decision involved unfair prejudice to the respondent, and students of like mind, within the meaning of s. 225(1)(a) of The Student's Aid Act and it can also be taken to have involved an unfair disregard for their interests within s.225(1(b).

The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT:
 The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005.
The petitioner, Evan Gavelin, requests joint custody with specified access.
While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support, there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive.
HELD: 1) Section 18 of the Guidelines provides that where an individual is shareholder, director or officer of a corporation and the Court is of the opinion that their Line 150 income does not 'fairly reflect all the money available... ' for child support the Court may attribute all or part of the pre-tax income of the corporation... to the individual.

 The purpose of interim orders is to establish temporary parenting arrangement pending trial or final resolution of the matter.
In making such orders, Courts try to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible and, for that purpose, often adopt the'status quo' subject to that being in the best interests of their children.

9,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director that effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy.
The landlord also denied its request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year.
After four months before the expiry of the second year, the tenant gave a proper notice that he wished to convert the tenancy into month-to-month tenancy, pursuant to the provisions of s. 10A of the Residential Tenancies Act.
He appealed.
A written decision was rendered a week later.
Based on his reading of the Act, the landlord could not deny the tenant's request that his lease be changed from a year- to-year lease to a month- to month.
As corollary to that finding, he declared the tenancy had not been terminated, as the tenant contended.","The landlord appealed an order of the Residential Tenancies Officer which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year-to-year lease into a month to month tenancy.

The words 'the consent of the landlord shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably withheld' must be given some meaning; the Act could not make it automatic, but that did not mean that the tenant's request to change from year- to-year to month would be given effect.
In effect, the landlord would have to contend with over-holding when he believes the market will have become soft.","Landlord and Tenant – Residential Tenancies Act – ConversionThe appellant landlord appealed from an order of the Director that effectively permitted the appellant to convert what had been a year-to-year lease into a month to month tenancy.
It also denied the landlord’s request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the appellant effectively refused to renew for another year.
The original lease ran from September 2007 to August 2008, and was renewed for one year, and the appellant gave a proper notice that he wished to convert the tenancy into month- to-month tenancy, pursuant to the provisions of s. 10A of the Act.
Four months before the expiry of the second year, the respondent gave notice of his intention to convert it into a one-year term.
He was given 30 days to respond, giving reasons why he believed it was not in his interest to have a month-to month tenancy (see: 2009).
The appellant appealed.
In his appeal, the appellant stated that based upon his reading of the Residential Tenancy Act, the landlord may not deny the tenant's request to change the lease from a year to year to month.

He appealed to the Court of Appeal.Appeal allowed; the tenancy had not been converted into month and month- to-month tenancy because the landlord had refused his consent in a timely manner for reasons that were neither arbitrary or unreasonable.
There was potential hardship on the tenant and he had not acted in good faith and had no way of knowing that his effort to convert it into month-to month would be thwarted.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy.

Four months before the expiry of the second year, the landlord gave the tenant proper notice.
He refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed it was not in his interest to have a month and month tenancy, which were considered in the written decision.
A written decision was rendered a week later.
Based on the written reasons, the officer declared that the lease had become month- to-month.
As corollary to that finding, he declared the tenancy had not been terminated, as the landlord contended.
When the landlord refused his consent, he made no finding that the reasons were either arbitrary or unreasonable.
In so failing to consider the Landlord's reasons, he erred in law.
Per Slone, adjudicator, allowing the appeal, the tenancy has not been converted into a year and a month tenancy because the landlord refuses his consent in a timely manner.
For reasons beyond the control of either the landlord or the tenant, they have been operating in a state of uncertainty, not knowing the status of the lease.
Their practical effect could work hardship on either or both of them, disproportionate to their actions.
Were the tenancy to be renewed again, it would place hardship on the Tenant and put him in effect of the effect of declaring the lease has been terminated and he may have to contend with vacancy when precisely he believes the market will become soft.
If the parties were unable to reach an understanding, they would be directed to convey the court's findings and determine the existing state of the tenancy."

In this case, the judge concluded however that the erratic behaviour may well have resulted from combination of both alcohol and a very hurting injured ankle, and the only foundation for the conclusion of impairment articulated in his rather rambling reasons for judgment are the references to beer consumption some hours earlier and '[t]he reading shows he is more than twice the legal limit....' The trial judge accepted that the accused's unsteadiness could have been function of the hurt ankle.
Consequently, he relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion."
