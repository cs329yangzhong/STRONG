WRT (row 2),A1,"I think there’s a risk that these models are “learning” that the word “HELD:” should appear somewhere in the middle of a summary, and that sequential numbers should be placed before some of the sentences late in the summary, but they don’t learn what “held” means and they don’t understand that the numbered items are supposed to be a list of holdings. So instead, they choose random places to put the word “HELD” and the numbers. Here, “HELD” is in the middle of the procedural summary.

The “Absent the application” sentence is a good statement of a legal conclusion, but it's not very clear that this conclusion doesn't determine the outcome of the appeal.

The grammar of the “The BIA supports” sentence seems wrong. Should it be “to do better”? I don’t understand why there’s a reason to reject the proposal here, if the conclusion is that the proposal should be accepted.

“No costs were awarded” is rarely an interesting sentence for a researcher, unless the whole opinion is about costs. “Costs” usually refers to a small percentage of the total money in dispute. I don’t consider it to be a holding when the court doesn’t give its reasoning.",Good. “HELD:” is used appropriately.,Starts out okay. Not totally clear that “the amendment” refers back to the “terms of the indemnity.”,Good. Fairly coherent.,"It would be better if it could remain in the past tense rather than switching back and forth to the present tense. It’s fairly coherent, but I don’t feel certain it captures the court’s reasons. It seems too long. If I wanted this level of detail, I’d probably choose to skim the opinion myself instead."

,A3,"It feels like this summary was included language that was too specific had I not read the oracle first I would only have a vague idea what it was talking about.  The fluency seems to fall apart in places, notably the sentence starting “1 of the Proposal. . .","This one was very good. I think the issue, reason, and conclusion were covered well","Same as with Sentbs, “No costs were awarded” isn’t worth including.","This starts off ok but almost immediately provides this “9.1 of the Proposal.” that I can’t make sense of. I’m not sure what those random strings of letters are, they look like fractured legal citations so maybe this is just a spacing error. However, this one concludes well and ends strong. Overall this one is good.","Fluency and readability seem to go back and forth on this one, its good in parts and its bad in parts. I can’t see where you’ve gained anything by the length of this one. In this case length seems to be hurting the strength of the summary."

Mortage (row 3),A1,"Does a good job stating an issue, but never reaches the conclusion.","No good statement of the issue, but maybe readers could infer the issue based on the conclusion “It was entitled to solicitor and other costs accrued by the plaintiff under its mortgage.”
The interest payment isn’t important enough to be in the summary","Fairly coherent, but it’s not totally clear the dispute is about “solicitor and client costs permitted under the mortgages.”","It’s not very clear about the issue, and it also doesn’t reveal how the issue came out.",This is very clear. Using the defendant’s full name might be a privacy problem. I also wonder if there’s a copyright problem with using the subject classification system at the start of the summary. It looks like it’s from the Law Society of Saskatchewan.
,A2,lacks conclusion. Dangling non-sentence at end.,Good summary. Good conclusion but misses conclusion about 8% costs.,Lacks conclusion. I don’t think plaintiff bank sold condo unit to defendant. Seems like a factual error.,This is like D but shorter. Maybe too short. Also misses conclusion about 8% costs.,A very good summary but maybe too long. The points in the material starting at Section 63 and through to the end seem correct but go beyond what is in oracle. Maybe these are less important details.
,A3,"This starts great and gives a lot of pertinent facts, but then never really concludes. Overall this one is ok.","This one is good. There are some extraneous details, but otherwise its fine.",It’s mistaking periods for ends of sentences.,"This one reads nice, but the reader is left to infer a lot about what the case might be about.  From this I can see that the plaintiff made some kind of claim and got some kind of judgment.  Other than that it is not clear. ",This one was great up until “Section 63 of the Condominium Property Act. . . “ Had it stopped before there it would have been really nice.  I think the length of this one allowed for unnecessary details to be put into the summary.

Row 4,A2,This mentions issues not addressed in the oracle like the self defense point. One would need to check full case. Doesn’t seem to capture the gist of the history.,A really good summary of the procedural history and some issues/conclusions except at the end where it seems to drop in mid-sentence.,: This summary started off OK but then got tangled up in factual details and ends in mid-sentence., A  good summary of the procedural history and some issues/conclusions but it says that the conviction was reinstated and a not guilty verdict must be entered. These are inconsistent!,This summary started off OK but included “preliminary matters” that are too detailed and unimportant to include in a summary.
,A1,"Very confusing. After “HELD:” and “1)” the summary goes on reciting procedural history. In a holding, the phrase “the court” normally would refer to the court making the holding. But here, it refers to a different court.
And there’s confusion between subjects and objects in “the respondent approached the respondent”","Very good, makes sense. “HELD:” and “1)” are in inappropriate places. Too bad it got cut off in the middle of a sentence.","In “HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction of the respondent was entered in Provincial Court,” the events are out of order, and “HELD:” doesn’t belong here.
Very incoherent grammar.
The summary gets cut off before ever reaching an issue or conclusion.","This summary spends the whole time summarizing the procedural history, and gets cut off before ever reaching an issue or conclusion. It uses “HELD:” and “1)” in inappropriate places. “1)” appears twice.","Mostly coherent. It’s strange that there are two lists of conclusions, the first one labeled with “1), 2), 3)” and the second one labeled with “First, second, third”. Both lists seem relevant. The summary says it will mention “two preliminary matters” but I don’t think it ever comes around to the second one."

Row 5,A1,"Very clear in explaining the identities of the parties and the cause of action, but never quite states an issue or conclusion.","This is clear about the issue and conclusion. A reason is missing (i.e. what did the defendant do to the logs other than harvesting them?).
It would be better if the summary could avoid first-person narration.
The sentence labeled “2)” is not really a separate issue from “1)”.","Some missing nouns make the summary very confusing, but it seems to cover issue, conclusion, and reasons.","This covers issue, conclusion, and reasons, and it has a clearer explanation of the reason than any of the above. The sentences labeled “2)” are not really a separate issue from “1)”.","Hallucinated name “Chim”?This is pretty clear, except after number “2)”"

Row 6,A2,Not a good summary. It starts to ramble. No issues. No conclusion.,Similar to C. Not a good summary. It starts to ramble. No issues. No conclusion.,This is similar to C and D but a bit better. At least we get to a conclusion.,This is a good summary.,"This is not as good as F. It ramble at the end and seems to introduce factual errors. E.g., it says “counsel had not concealed the structural defect.” Counsel is the lawyer. The seller concealed the defect."
,A3,"It’s clear, but never reaches an issue or conclusion.","Also clear, but never reaches an issue or conclusion.","A noun error makes it unclear who the parties are (“appellants appealed a Small Claims Court judgment in which the trial judge found that the appellants had proven”). The cause of action never really becomes clear, and the summary gets cut off before reaching the specific legal issue.",This is clear and covers the IRCs. The numbers are in reasonable places.,"This gives a fairly good understanding of the issue and conclusion.In “Hancock sent a demand for payment of these repair costs to the respondents,” I think it should be “appellants”, not “respondents”.

I can’t tell what the “Although counsel submitted” sentence is about.

There’s no explanation of the significance of “counsel had not concealed the structural defect,” so it seems like the noun ""counsel"" could be a mistake."

row 7,A2,Not a good summary; stopped in mid-stream. Didn’t address stay of proceedings after 4th trial.,This is similar to C.,This is similar to C and D.,"This is a better summary. It includes the stay of proceedings but seems to make a factual error. It says the trial judge stayed the proceedings but according to the Oracle, the appellate court stayed the proceedings.",This is a bad summary. It seems to wander all over the place and include extraneous details like a Corrigendum and text excerpts that don’t seem relevant.
,A3,This was generally ok. The last sentence looks to be extraneous.,This one was good up until and including the statement “A new trial is ordered.” Everything after that should go and it being there detracts from the summary.,"Again, this one was generally good up until the last sentence.  There’s some behavior here, by the model that looks like its trying to fit information in there to fill space when id definitely doesn’t need to. ","This one was good. There’s a clear issue, rules, and a conclusion.","Fluency seems to be a problem with this one “a very hurting injured ankle” is not right. This one is also suspiciously different from the other ones due to its focus on the ankle.  You might want to investigate that. This one seemed to be inline with the other summaries, and then starting talking about the ankle, which didn’t make sense."
